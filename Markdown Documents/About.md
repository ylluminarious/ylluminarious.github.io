Hello! Welcome to my blog. I am a software developer who enjoys making new
things and I would like to share some of the stuff I've learned. I wanted to
blog for a while, but never had time for it. Now I'm making time because I want
to have my own space where I can dump some of my ideas and work in a documented
format. Sort of like a public diary. I guess that's what a blog *is*, after
all...

Â 

I hope you enjoy your stay and learn something interesting.
